To use stylesheet and logo in this theme, define styleSheetURL and logoURL
members in Edit class.  Sample stylesheet is available in static subdirectory
of theme, so you can just copy (link or make available in other way, e.g. with
apache's Alias directive) it to somewere under site root.

For example:

class Edit(qEdit.Edit):
    styleSheetURL = '/edit-style.css'
    logoURL = '/logo.png'
